These profiles should be used to record/transmit the data surrounding the context of how, when, and where an individual's exposure to SARS CoV 2 occurred.  The profiles consist of questions about known exposure (it's known that the individual was or was not exposed to SARS CoV 2), exposure type (who, what, how, etc.),  and travel history (where and when the exposure happened.)
