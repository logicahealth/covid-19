#### Signs and Symptoms

The following profiles are for recording/transmitting data associated with COVID19 signs and symptoms.  This is not a comprehensive list.  It will be added to as we receive information from contributing partners.

There are two profiles in this area, one for the assertion of the presence of the sign or symptom and one for the assertion of the absence of the sign or symptom.  We fell this adds a level of safety to the recoding/transmitting of this data.  Using a single profile to represent the presence and absence of a symptom could result in the mis-identification of a symptom's being present when it is absent.
